    <h2>SOLID</h2>
    <h3>- Single responsibility principle</h3>
    <div id="s-comments"></div>
    <h3>- The Open Closed Principle</h3>
    <p>Class or function should be open for using and extending but not for modifying.</p>
    <p>React lifecycles appropriate to Open-Closed Principle the same as decorators. (example_1)</p>
    <p>Transaction classes appropriate to Open-Closed Principle. (example_2)</p>
    <h3>- The Liskov Substitution Principle</h3>
    <p>subtype that extends the basic class cannot be basic class of another subtype</p>
    <p>Input Controller exists. It is basic type for searchPanl, DropdownWithSearch and Textarea.
        But SearchPanel cannot be basic for DropDown And Textarea (example_1)</p>
    <p>AuthHandler exists. It is basic type for GoogleAuth, FacebookAuth and TwitterAuth.
        But GoogleAuth cannot be basic for FacebookAuth And TwitterAuth (auth_ex)</p>
    <p>Request exists. It is basic type for User and Topics.
        But User cannot be basic for Topics (requests)</p>
    <h3>- The Interface Segregation Principle</h3>
    <p>If not every subtype can implemnents methods from abstract class, abstract class mustn`t consist it</p>
    <p>xbox abstract class exist. It has getKinect method. But not every type of xbox has kinect, so we compelling
        to create stumbs.</p>
    <p>authAbstract suppose to have some properties. But if we realize ownAuth method, the properties isn`t match with
        abstract method. So abstract method need to create right props in advance</p>
    <h3>- The Dependency Inversion Principle</h3>
    <p>High-level modelu should not depend on details of another module. And vice versa. They should depend ob abstraction</p>
    <p>Send message class has message method inside. Message can be created with link. And when parse link, we should ensure that every type of link are accepted</p>
